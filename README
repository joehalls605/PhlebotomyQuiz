Phlebotomy Quiz Application

This application tests your knowledge of phlebotomy with multiple choice questions.

Logic overview:

startGame() shuffles the array of questions, it then shows the random emoji and calls the loadQuestion function.

loadQuestion() creates a current question based on the array of questions. It then gets three incorrect answers and one correct answer. A hint is also hidden unless revealed by the user. The game can also end if the max question limit is reached.

getIncorectAnswers() this returns an array of answers that do not equal the correct current answer.

checkAnswer() validates if the user input answer is equal to the correct current answer.
